/* IPC MEANS interprocess communication
Interprocess communication is a set of programming interfaces  that allow a programmer  to coordinate activities  amon
different program processes that can run concurrently in an OS. This allows a program to handle many user
 requests at the same time. Since even a single user request may result in multiple processes running
 in the operating system on the user's behalf, the processes need to communicate with each other.
 The IPC interfaces make this possible. Each IPC method has its own advantages
 and limitations so it is not unusual for a single program to use all of the IPC methods.
*/

// RPC means remote procedural call
/* RPC is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program
located in another computer on a ntwork without having to understand the networks details
A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.

RPC (JSON OR XML RPC)is a protocol of an API
REST is another one


REST is all about a client-server relationship, where server-side data are made
 available through representations of data in simple formats, often JSON and XML.
 These representations for resources, or collections of resources, which are then potentially modifiable,
  with actions and relationships being made discoverable via a method known as hypermedia.
  Hypermedia is fundamental to REST, and is essentially just the concept of providing links to other resources. */
